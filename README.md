Placeholder for now. Will update eventually.

All non-test code up to project 6 (exclusive) is completely written by Sean Scheetz (me). The tests were added after the initial project submission for grading purposes.
This code was written for a compilers class taught by John Karro at Miami University. Instructions were abstract.
The overwhelming majority of code in project 6 and 7 is also written by me.

Note: The code is pretty good up to Project 6. Code in project 6/7 is functional, but isn't as polished/clean.
