## Notes

- api_tester.py is your unit tests

- tester.py is the file I used to tests my methods as I worked

- This does assume the tree at least has 1 node. I didn't check most things that you didn't explcitly say because I wanted it to be kind of efficient....even though its python.

- Multiple alphanumeric character labels are accepted, but every node must have a label. I remember you saying that was okay in class.
