Can I assume the newick string coming in to the parse_newick function is optimal if it doesn't have an error?
    e.g. Do I need to check for a child list that has no elements? "()a"
    already have it implemented, but if I can take it out it will be more efficient
	
How exactly do you determine what the conditionals are in each grammar function?
	I think this is called the predict set? Is it whatever could possible come immediately after the current symbol?
	I don't think so because in the production S -> S{, S}\w+ a "," can come after an S, but you don't explictly need that
	I'm guessing predict and first set must be different. Gotta figure it out.
